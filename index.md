## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Luciana Ruggiero, and I am an early M.Eng. student in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University with a focused interest in biotechnology and biomedical device development. I am drawn to engineering roles at the intersection of design, manufacturing, and supplier engineering, where technical decisions directly influence product performance, reliability, and patient safety.

Through internships in medical device companies and hands-on project work, I have developed experience translating design intent into manufacturable, validated solutions. My background spans mechanical design, prototyping, GD&T-driven inspection, process optimization, and system-level problem solving across both early-stage and production environments. I am particularly motivated by work that balances engineering rigor with real-world constraints such as cost, scalability, and accessibility.

I enjoy collaborative, team-based environments and value iterative problem solving grounded in testing, user feedback, and cross-functional communication. Across my academic and professional experiences, I have developed a strong commitment to improving healthcare outcomes through practical mechanical engineering solutions that enhance safety, accessibility, and quality of care.
