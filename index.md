## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Luciana Ruggiero and I am an early M.Eng. mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in biotechnology and biomedical device development. I am particularly drawn to roles that involve design, manufacturing, and supplier engineering, where technical decision-making directly impacts product performance and reliability. I enjoy working in collaborative, team-based environments and value the process of developing solutions through shared problem-solving and iteration. Through my academic and project experience, I have developed a passion for improving healthcare outcomes from a mechanical engineering perspective, focusing on practical, manufacturable solutions that enhance safety, accessibility, and patient care.
