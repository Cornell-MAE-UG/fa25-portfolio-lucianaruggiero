## Engineering World Health (EWH) Project Team

As a member of the Engineering World Health Project Team at Cornell, I worked on interdisciplinary medical device projects focused on improving healthcare access in low-resource settings. I contributed as an integrative design engineer, using Fusion 360 and hands-on prototyping to develop affordable, manufacturable solutions for real clinical needs. Across projects, I balanced technical rigor with accessibility, cost constraints, and user needs, reinforcing my interest in mission-driven medical device design.

#### Calmer Device for Premature Infants

I contributed to designing and manufacturing a low-cost calming device intended to support premature infants in resource-limited clinical environments. The project emphasized simplicity, manufacturability, and safety while still meeting functional performance requirements. I helped through testing our CAD development in Fusion 360, iterated through physical prototypes, and refined the design to reduce cost without compromising effectiveness. The final design placed first at the 2022 Engineering World Health Design Competition, highlighting its impact and feasibility.

#### One-Size Prosthetic Foot

I also aided in engineering a one-size prosthetic foot designed to improve accessibility by reducing the need for multiple sizes and complex fittings. My work focused on CAD modeling, material considerations, and static testing to evaluate structural integrity and functional reliability. Through this project, I gained experience designing for durability and real-world constraints while ensuring the device could be produced and deployed in low-resource settings.
