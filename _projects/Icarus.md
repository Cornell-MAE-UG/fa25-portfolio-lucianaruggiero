## Icarus Medical Innovations 
##### — Design Engineering Intern


During my internship at Icarus Medical Innovations, I worked on the mechanical design and validation of lower-limb orthopedic devices, with an emphasis on structural performance, manufacturability, and clinical usability. I redesigned a locking mechanism for a knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO), leading CAD development in Fusion 360 through multiple design iterations informed by tolerance considerations, material selection, and user interaction requirements. The final design was prototyped, surface finished, assembled, and validated through physical testing and finite element analysis, and is now deployed in active use.

In addition to mechanical design, I supported product accessibility efforts by researching foot anatomy and developing a sizing guide for off-the-shelf ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), helping address growing demand while supporting clinical fit and sales efforts. I also redesigned an existing AFO into a nighttime model based on material research and market needs, assembling and testing a functional prototype to evaluate performance and comfort.

Across projects, I worked closely with clinicians and engineers, strengthening my ability to translate anatomical and user requirements into manufacturable designs and reinforcing my interest in hands-on medical device development.
