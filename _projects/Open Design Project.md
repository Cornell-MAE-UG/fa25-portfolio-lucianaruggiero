## Open Design Project
##### — Snow Shovel & Salt Dropper

#### Overview

This Open Design Project was completed as part of MAE 2250 (Mechanical Synthesis) and focused on designing and building a combined snow shovel and salt dropper to reduce physical effort while improving efficiency during winter maintenance. The project emphasized mechanical synthesis, user-informed decision making, and realistic manufacturing constraints. The final prototype demonstrated an integrated, mechanically driven solution suitable for repeated outdoor use.

#### System Concept & Mechanical Synthesis

The design integrated a wheeled snow shovel with a mechanically driven salt dispensing mechanism. As the shovel moves forward, the mechanism induces controlled motion of the salt box, enabling periodic salt release without electronics or additional user input.

This approach synchronized snow removal and salt distribution while maintaining system simplicity, durability, and reliability in winter conditions.

#### User Research & Iteration

User surveys were conducted to understand winter maintenance routines, ergonomic challenges, and usability needs. Survey feedback informed key design decisions, including handle geometry, force application, system stability, and salt dispensing frequency.

The team iterated through multiple prototype versions, combining user input and physical testing to refine comfort, mechanical performance, and repeatability.

#### Design for Assembly & Material Choices

The system was designed with assembly and manufacturability in mind, favoring mechanically constrained joints over adhesive-based connections to improve repeatability, repairability, and long-term durability.

Material selection also considered sustainability and structural performance, favoring wood over acrylic where possible to reduce plastic use while maintaining stiffness and robustness.

#### Outcome

The final prototype successfully demonstrated a mechanically integrated snow removal and salt dispensing system. The project established a strong foundation in hands-on engineering design and reinforced the importance of iteration, user research, and mechanically driven problem solving.
