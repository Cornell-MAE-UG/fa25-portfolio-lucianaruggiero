### Intuitive Surgical 
##### — Supplier Process Engineering Intern

During my internship at Intuitive Surgical, I worked within the SP Systems team as a Supplier Process Engineering Intern, supporting the evaluation, optimization, and implementation of manufacturing processes for production components. My role focused on bridging design intent, supplier capability, and manufacturing efficiency to improve part quality, reliability, and cost.

I collaborated directly with suppliers to assess manufacturing methods and identify opportunities for process improvement and cost reduction. This included conducting root cause analyses on part failures, driving corrective actions, and verifying compliance with engineering specifications through GD&T-based inspection and evaluation.

In addition to supplier-facing work, I supported internal manufacturing optimization efforts by developing and executing database queries to streamline material-based part searches and improve decision-making efficiency.

Through this experience, I strengthened my understanding of high and low-volume medical device manufacturing, supplier quality engineering, and the practical application of design-for-manufacturing principles within a regulated, production-scale environment.
